Aptly named "a solitary goanna" because I was going to name it "a *collective noun for goanna* of goannas" but there is no collective noun for a goanna - they're solitary creatures. And according to the GitHub roasting website, I'm "channelling a lizard that spends most of its life in a hole"

So of course, as an introvert myself, what better name than "a solitary goanna"?
