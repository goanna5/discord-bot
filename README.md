Aptly named "a solitary goanna" because I was going to name it "a *collective noun for goanna* of goannas" but there is no collective noun for a goanna - they're solitary creatures.

So of course, as an introvert myself, what better name than a solitary goanna?

Still need to work out what I want it to do, but it can send messages now :))
